# Scurri API

The Scurri Platform API is a RESTful web service that offers import
and update functionality for consignments, documents and manifests.

Scurri have APIâ€™s available for [delivery options at checkout](https://scurrideliveryoptionsapi.docs.apiary.io/#)
and [delivery locations](https://deliverylocationsapi.docs.apiary.io/#).
There is a tracking API available for pulling back tracking data, information on this is available on request.

## HTTP Codes

HTTP codes are used to differentiate between successful and failed
responses. As per the HTTP standard: 20x codes are for successful
requests, 40x codes for errors with validation or permissions, 50x
codes for unexpected internal server errors.


## Authentication

All requests must be authenticated using either [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) or API token-based authentication.
If you have been provided with an API token, you should use token-based authentication.

### Basic Auth

With Basic Auth, you have to send the username and password **base64-encoded** in the standard Basic manner, e.g.
`Authorization: Basic YXBpdGVzdDphcGkgcGFzc3dvcmQgdGVzdA==`.

Here is some sample code in Python to generate the value of the header:

```python
>>> import base64
>>> username = 'apitest'
>>> password = 'api-test-password'
>>> print base64.b64encode(username + ':' + password)
YXBpdGVzdDphcGktdGVzdC1wYXNzd29yZA==
```

### API Token

With API token-based authentication, you must include the token in the Authorization header as an API token, e.g.
`Authorization: token YOUR_API_TOKEN`.

Failed requests will return a 401 HTTP code with `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` response header.

## Request format

All body payloads must be in JSON format, unless stated otherwise.

As a result, the `Content-Type` header must be set to `application/json`.

## Using the Scurri API

### General

The most important features of the Scurri API are:

- Importing consignments
- Getting the necessary documents (labels and/or commercial invoices)
- Manifesting consignments

The Scurri API works only on top of HTTPS, so that the connection is
encrypted.

The Scurri API is currently at version 1. This means that all URLs
should be prefixed with the path `/v1/`.

### Concepts

Each company is assigned a **slug**, which is an identifier for this
company and is used in all URLs of this API. The slug can be found in
the URLs used in Scurri: it is the value after the path `company` and
until the next forward slash (`/`). That is, in the URL
`/company/my-company/manifests` the slug is the value `my-company`.

Each consignment is identified by a unique **identifier** which you
can optionally provide. This identifier should be unique across all of your
consignments. If all of your orders correspond to a single
consignment, then the order number is a good candidate for this. If
you do not provide an identifier for the consignments, scurri will
generate a unique id.

### Consignment Lifecycle

#### Importing consignments

The first step is to import your consignments into Scurri. They can be imported individually (one by one) or as part of a batch. Scurri has optimized the
import process to support importing thousands of consignments in one
API call.

#### Getting the label for a consignment

After a consignment has been imported, Scurri will automatically
allocate it to a carrier and a service based on the shipment rules you
have defined in our user interface, alternatively you can specificy these values in the API (and in doing so overwrite any shipment rules that may already be set up).

At this point Scurri will try to validate that the consignment meets the
criteria for using the specified carrier and service, e.g. typically these would be the weight limits,
dimension limits and destination restrictions.

If the consignment does not fail the validation step you can download
its label(s) and any customs documentation required, either as PDF documents or
PNG. The latter is useful for embedding the label(s) in another document.
After the label has been generated, the tracking number for the consignment is available in the consignment details.

If, on the other hand, this validation had failed (that it exceeds the
weight, dimension or destination limits and restrictions) then you
would get an error back with the reason the validation failed.

#### Manifesting consignments

The last step is marking the consignments as manifested. When you do
this, Scurri will generate the manifest documentation that you may
have to provide to the carrier and at the same time notify the
carrier. Note - Once you've manifested a conisgnment it will no longer
be available for editing.

# Carriers [/company/{company_slug}/carriers/]

The Carriers API allows you to query Scurri for the carriers that are
enabled in your account.

The result contains the identifier for each carrier, which you can use
in the rest of the API calls, whenever a **Carrier** needs to be
specified.  The identifier will never change, so this can be called
once to get the values.

# Group Consignments

## Consignments Collection [/company/{company_slug}/consignments/]

This group of API calls allow you to interact with your consignments
in Scurri. You can list and search through them, create new ones, get
their status and print the necessary documentation (labels and custom
invoices, when needed).

+ Parameters
    + company_slug: `api-test-company` (string) - The slug of your company in Scurri.

### Get the list of created consignments [GET /company/{company_slug}/consignments/{?offset,limit,identifier,status}]

Scurri.

Pagination is provided via the `offset` and `limit` GET parameters.

For the `offset`, we don't use an integer value but instead use the last
`identifier` of the current batch. The `next` value returned with the
response body contains a URL you can use to retrieve the next batch.

Example offset URL: `https://sandbox.scurri.co.uk/api/v1/company/test-company/consignments/?offset=000ed1bfb93c43319ec79247f50dfd3c`

You can also use this API call to search for consignments using
specific criteria, either for a specific `identifier` or for
consignments of a specific `status`.
This API cannot be used to search for multiple consignments by their identifiers,
you may only search for a single consignment by identifier.

The `Despatched`, `Delivered` and `Exception` statuses are only available if Tracking has been enabled on your account.

### Create a New Consignment [POST]

You can use this API call to create one or more new consignments. In
both cases, you have to specify a list in the body.

Scurri will do its best to store the data in the database and return a
successful message, instead of validating the data against a carrier.
That is, the validation process with a carrier is a step performed
after a consignment has been created successfully.  The reason is that
this way Scurri can decouple importing consignment data from allocating
it to a specific carrier, each of which has different requirements.

What this means in practice is that a success response for this API
call does not mean that the consignment has been allocated to a
carrier and service successfully.

Additionally, most users will want their configured rules to
allocate a consignment to a carrier and service. These users should
leave the carrier-related fields empty. If any of those are specified
in the request, then they will override the allocation made by rules.

Rules are always executed against your consignment data during the
allocation phase.

Another thing to keep in mind is that, in the case of batch creating
consignments, Scurri will run any allocation processes
asynchronously. As a result, a label will not be available straight
away. If your request contains data only for a single consignment then
the allocation happens synchronously.

If you need a way to associate your internal packages with Scurri packages,
please use the key `reference` that is available for each `package`.

The `reference` don't need to be unique per company or per item.

Finally, some carriers support enhancements and carrier-specific options which
must be specified in the "options" field, in example: Signed Consignments
("signed") or Package Type ("package_type").

You can take a look at the
[GET consignment](#reference/consignments/consignments/get-a-single-consignment)
for the payload of this request.

Max field lengths may be carrier dependant.

## Consignment Documents [/company/{company_slug}/consignment/{consignment_id}/documents/{?documenttype,label_quantity,invoice_quantity}]

### Get the label and the invoice for the consignment [GET]

You can use this API call to get the label and any customs invoice
documents required for a specific consignment, if required.

Keep in mind that a label will be created for each package of the
consignment.

#### Available label formats

The resulting documents are returned as strings within the JSON response. These are plaintext in the case of ZPL labels, all other formats are base64-encoded binary files. 
Labels can be provided in the following formats:
- PDF: One PDF returned with multiple labels concatenated in a single document (one label per page)
- PNG: A ZIP file is returned containing all files
- X-png-list: Single file PNGs (non-zipped)
- ZPL: Can be configured as 230 or 300 DPI resolution. It's also possible to specify the required label resolution or compress the label in the request.

Alternative label formats are also available, for example 8"x4". To enable this feature on your account, contact Scurri support. Once enabled the label customisation parameter can be used.

#### Customs Invoice Documents

About the customs invoice documents, Scurri will return the documents
the carrier requires, only if the carrier does require them for the
specific consignment.

Another thing to note about customs invoice documents is that they can
be either in a 6"x4" size (for thermal printer) or in an A4 size (for
a document printer). Your account can be configured, so that 6"x4"
thermal invoices can be concatenated with the respective label. This
makes it easier to send each file to the correct printer.

Note that setting documenttype to `application/x-zebra-zpl` only impacts labels, not invoices - they remain PDF as they are A4.

# Group Manifests

The manifest process marks a list of consignments as ready to be
picked up by the carrier.

A manifest always refers to a specific warehouse and carrier. Scurri
abstracts away the necessary actions and documentation a carrier needs
and presents a common interface for the manifest process.

## Creating Manifests [/company/{company_slug}/manifest/]

### Create a manifest [POST]

You can use this API call to mark a list of consignments for a
**specific carrier** and **specific warehouse** as manifested.

This API call will mark the specified consignments as manifested
within Scurri and perform any post-manifest actions, such as generate
the necessary documentation for a manifest and send any pre-alert data
to the carrier.
