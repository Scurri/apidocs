  title: Scurri Platform API
  version: 1.0.0

    This API allows you to manage consignments, including creating, updating, and retrieving details about shipments.
    You can also manage packages within consignments and retrieve associated documents such as labels and customs invoices.

  - name: Consignments
    description: |
      This group of API calls allow you to interact with your consignments in Scurri. You can list and
      search through them, create new ones, get their status and print the necessary documentation
      (labels and custom invoices, when needed).
  - name: Consignment Documents
    description: |
      You can use this API call to get the label and any customs invoice documents required for a specific consignment, if required.Keep in mind that a label will be created for each package of the consignment.
      ## Available label formats
      The resulting documents are base64-encoded and they can be provided in the following formats:
      - PDF: One PDF returned with multiple labels concatenated in a single document (one label per page)
      - PNG: A ZIP file is returned containing all files
      - X-png-list: Single file PNGs (non-zipped)
      - ZPL: Can be configured as 230 or 300 DPI resolution. It's also possible to specify the required label resolution or compress the label in the request.


      Alternative label formats are also available, for example 8"x4". To enable this feature on your account, contact Scurri support. Once enabled the label customisation parameter can be used.
      ## Customs Invoice Documents

      Scurri will return the documents the carrier requires, only if the carrier does require them for the specific consignment.Another thing to note about customs invoice documents is that they can be either in a **6"x4"** size (for thermal printer) or in an **A4** size (for a document printer). Your account can be configured, so that **6"x4"** thermal invoices can be concatenated with the respective label. This makes it easier to send each file to the correct printer. Note that setting documenttype to `application/x-zebra-zpl` only impacts labels, not invoices - they remain PDF as they are A4.
